# QuadraticEuationPlotter
A quadratic equation is any equation having the form: ax+bx+c=0 , where x represents an unknown, and a, b, and c represent known numbers such that a is not equal to 0. We implement a quadratic equation plotter which uses python tkinter library to create a GUI window with a custom dialog.
